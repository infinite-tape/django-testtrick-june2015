I'm so happy.    \n\n[Pictures](http://imgur.com/a/GN5RG/rescue_kitty)", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "e2xa6", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Groots", "media": null, "score": 1137, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 407, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1o", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "from": null, "is_self": true, "from_id": null, "permalink": "/r/aww/comments/e2xa6/saved_a_freezing_to_death_kitten/?ref=search_posts", "name": "t3_e2xa6", "created": 1289226884.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/e2xa6/saved_a_freezing_to_death_kitten/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "Saved a freezing to death kitten.", "created_utc": 1289226884.0, "distinguished": null, "mod_reports": [], "visited": false, "num_reports": null, "ups": 1137}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"domain": "self.tifu", "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "tifu", "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I recently got a new kitten, she is absolutely adorable, fuzzy, cuddly, likes to lick my nose, she&amp;#39;s a fantastic cat.

Thank you all so much!) to cover Buster&amp;#39;s operation, emergency care, vaccinations probably, and maybe even the latter-most for his sibling if we can catch him or her \u2014 we just spent a long time outside again looking for it, but sadly to no avail.  The food I left out for it though was mostly gone, so at least something or someone got something to eat.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There may be some leftovers in the Buster Fund, so now I&amp;#39;m asking you guys one last thing:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;What should be done with that?  Obviously, I don&amp;#39;t know how much will be left, but I&amp;#39;ll keep everyone updated as he gets better, etc.  Someone earlier mentioned potentially donating the money to the local shelters, but would some others prefer that some donations be refunded, or\u2026 I don&amp;#39;t know what else.  I&amp;#39;m just so relieved and thankful for the generosity of all you redditors, and the financial concerns really aren&amp;#39;t concerns any longer.  Thank you guys, so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;There are a shit-load of comments, and it&amp;#39;s pretty late; I fully intend on reading what everyone has to say, as well as getting back to everyone, but I&amp;#39;m about to pass out, so I&amp;#39;ll be back tomorrow [morning].  Thanks again!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy crap, guys, I never expected Buster to get this much exposure.  Man\u2026 if he only knew how much attention he was getting, I&amp;#39;m pretty sure it would blow his little kitty brain.  You guys have donated $363.07 already (as of (9:51 PM EST)!  I&amp;#39;m trying to be careful to watch it \u2014 if it goes much higher, I&amp;#39;m taking down the link, as I would honestly feel absolutely awful if more was donated than the costs of fixing him up\u2026.  I know there&amp;#39;s more that goes into just initially fixing-him-up, like having him neutered, vaccinated, and whatever else.  This is already more than enough to re-coup what my girlfriend and I spent last night at the vet and getting supplies for him \u2014 food, a litter box, etc. \u2014 as well as much of what I know is to come.  Thank you guys so, so much; Redditors, you are beyond awesome!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As of now, I&amp;#39;m just going through the posts, replying as I can.  Obviously, there are a shit-load of comments, and I&amp;#39;m reading them all and commenting with all the effort and sincerity I usually apply, even when I don&amp;#39;t have a couple hundred more to read and potentially reply to.  Honestly, it&amp;#39;s the very least I can do to give all of you who have given me your time, consideration, and thirty-nine (!) people who have also given some of their money.  So, to everyone, including those who chipped in a couple bucks along with notes saying they wish they could do more, I greatly, greatly appreciate it, beyond what words I can muster\u2026 thank you.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for updates on Buster\u2026 well, &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/kBBXZ.jpg\"&gt;he&amp;#39;s asleep here on my lap&lt;/a&gt;, purring up a bloody storm.  He&amp;#39;s learned very quickly what we intend him to use the litter box for, has been eating voraciously, and is really just as awesome of a kitten/cat as anyone could ever want.  I&amp;#39;ve updated pictures in the album, so you can see for yourself.  As you can probably very easily understand and believe, my girlfriend (and I admit, myself) are getting attached to him, as much as I tried not to.  Truth is, I&amp;#39;ve always been a cat guy, as I had a cat (only pet I&amp;#39;ve ever had) growing up who died of lymphoma when I was 13, and I&amp;#39;ve really wanted a cat for at least the past 7 years.  My girlfriend is in a semi-similar boat, except her parents have 3 old cats and her brother rescued two kittens (sisters) last year, so naturally, we&amp;#39;re doing everything we can to find a place for Buster where we can still see him often.  My roommate isn&amp;#39;t yielding, and as it&amp;#39;s her place and she is allergic, I&amp;#39;m not pressuring her and respecting her decision.  My girlfriend however\u2026  she&amp;#39;s pressuring her roommates, and they&amp;#39;re actually growing more and more receptive of the idea of him staying there, but it&amp;#39;s still seemingly a temporary provision.  She is highly allergic to cats, too, so he probably wouldn&amp;#39;t be allowed upstairs, but at least the three of us could stay together.  I understand how this potentially changes circumstances, and as such I&amp;#39;d be more than willing to refund any donations given under the premise that I&amp;#39;d be helping this kitten out, then passing him on to another home.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, if anyone has any more questions or comments to leave, don&amp;#39;t hesitate to do so*, but I need to play DD for a friend in about ten minutes, so I won&amp;#39;t be around to continue commenting/replying for a little while.  I will get to everyone though; I&amp;#39;m in disbelief of the generosity for the sake of this little kitten \u2014 $491.75 now at 10:43!  Thank you all so much!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;* all three of my camera batteries are dead, so I&amp;#39;m going to recharge one before I leave.  Til then, no more kitty pictures, but I have tons more I could upload to imgur. =)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;update 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://this_doesn&amp;#x27;t_go_anywhere_stop_clicking_me.com\"&gt;Paypal link taken down&lt;/a&gt;; thanks to everyone in advance!

A lot of people have offered to chip in for the surgery, so I called the veterinary clinic to see if I could set up an account for credit to pay for the surgery, but they&amp;#39;re currently only open for emergency services, so I was told to call back on Monday when the staff who deal with billing are in.  &lt;a href=\"http://this_doesn&amp;#x27;t_go_anywhere_stop_clicking_me.com\"&gt;Until then,  Paypal link taken down&lt;/a&gt;.  Thank you again to everybody!  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;For those who are curious, here&amp;#39;s the vet clinic I went to last night (and the service was great, despite the poor reviews):&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps/place?oe=utf-8&amp;amp;q=town+and+country+vet+christiansburg&amp;amp;fb=1&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;amp;hq=town+and+country+vet&amp;amp;hnear=Christiansburg,+VA&amp;amp;cid=17086377072948266377\"&gt;Town &amp;amp; Country Veterinary Clinic&lt;br/&gt;\n1605 N Franklin St, Christiansburg, VA 24073-1401&lt;br/&gt;\n(540) 382-5042&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"http://tcvccares.com\"&gt;tcvccares.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;original post&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://zargathe.imgur.com/buster_cat\"&gt;Here are some images&lt;/a&gt;, but I warn you, the last few images of his arm is gruesome.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I say [almost-]3-pawed, as the kitten&amp;#39;s front right arm is mangled beyond repair; the bones are shattered and visible in the open wound, which is obviously infected and oozing.  In spite of this, he&amp;#39;s been walking on it for at least a month and a half, so it&amp;#39;s flattened, blackened, and just really, really bad.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s when I first saw this kitten what I assume is its sibling \u2014 around early august, and I&amp;#39;ve been putting food out for him for a couple weeks.  My girlfriend, a friend of ours, and I saw this kitten yesterday evening sitting by a dumpster, looking pathetic.  I parked my car and got some cat food and a paper plate out I had in my car, and put it out for him.  He was obviously uncomfortable by my being there and wouldn&amp;#39;t approach the food (near me, about 5 feet away from him), so I walked away\u2026 to the other side of the fence containing the dumpster area.  I then saw this kitten inhaling the food, and the other one come out from under a bush on the other side of the fence.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the first time I actually got to see the broken arm close enough to get a real feel for how bad it actually is\u2026 and I remembered &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/comments/c9dp2/i_found_this_kitten_last_night_his_tail_is_broken/\"&gt;kita&amp;#39;s post about 3 months ago about Mailbox and his mangled/infected tail&lt;/a&gt;, in particular this line:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We took him in to the vet. They said we brought him just in time, his tail was badly infected and was getting maggots. The tail is being amputated as we speak.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I decided that we had to help at least this kitten, but I&amp;#39;d try to keep the two of them together.  So, the kitten with the broken arm was very easy to catch, not just because he&amp;#39;s handicapped, but because he was just lying in a little hollow under a bush, and he didn&amp;#39;t really mind getting caught.  The other kitten ran away, and we weren&amp;#39;t able to catch it.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We took the kitten to an emergency veterinary clinic where they told us that the arm is broken in many places (he may have gotten it caught on something or hit by a car), and since it&amp;#39;s already badly infected, operating on it is very unlikely to be successful.  He&amp;#39;s about 12 weeks old now, but is very skinny.  Apparently if I hadn&amp;#39;t been feeding him, he wouldn&amp;#39;t have been able to survive.  His arm isn&amp;#39;t immediately life-threatening, so he&amp;#39;s going back on Monday for the amputation during regular business hours.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, now this will leave me with a tripod kitten that has become very affectionate to people which I can&amp;#39;t keep, as my roommate [whose parents own the place] is allergic to cats and prohibits them being in the apartment, along with a $150 bill I charged last night and a $400 - $600 bill on Monday which I really can&amp;#39;t afford.  I know I brought it upon myself, so I&amp;#39;m doing what I can to find a way to pay/see if other veterinary clinics can do the surgery for less, but what I&amp;#39;d really like to find is someone who can take him in.  Again, keeping the two kittens together would be ideal.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, is there anyone in or around Blacksburg, VA who would like to take in a tripod kitten and maybe its sibling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "**update 5**\u2026\n\n[\u2026is over here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Pets/comments/djtgn/buster_the_soontobe_tripod_kitty_update/).\n\n**update 4**\n\nA little after 4 AM, and I am yet again\u2026 I don't even know what the word is.

Again, keeping the two kittens together would be ideal.\n\n**So, is there anyone in or around Blacksburg, VA who would like to take in a tripod kitten and maybe its sibling?**", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": null, "id": "ditev", "from_kind": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "clicked": false, "report_reasons": null, "author": "Zargathe", "media": null, "score": 843, "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "hidden": false, "num_comments": 480, "thumbnail": "", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh1i", "edited": true, "link_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "downs": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "saved": false, "removal_reason": null, "stickied": false, "from": null, "is_self": true, "from_id": null, "permalink": "/r/AskReddit/comments/ditev/for_the_past_month_and_a_half_ive_seen_this/?ref=search_posts", "name": "t3_ditev", "created": 1285442836.0, "url": "http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ditev/for_the_past_month_and_a_half_ive_seen_this/", "author_flair_text": null, "title": "For the past month and a half I've seen this [almost-]3-pawed kitten hobbling around my apartment parking lot.

Even the trolls, thank you guys so much.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And here is my story:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;hr/&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So last week I saw this poor little kitten sitting outside the closed bar in my apartment complex.  I was so sad for this poor kitten, but I was late for work and couldn&amp;#39;t stop.  Then on Monday as I was leaving for the store I saw the kitten again!  Only there were two of them!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So I went back to my apartment, grabbed a box. and some treats and set out to catch &amp;#39;em all pokemon style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I set up some treats and along came &lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/q2rzv.jpg\"&gt;these two guys&lt;/a&gt;.  And I was like sweet!  But they never came out of the bushes when I was nearby.  I was very sad.  So I had some wet cat food lying around and I figured that might coax them out!&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/8Lesg.jpg\"&gt;And with luck it did&lt;/a&gt;.  Sadly the end result was the same, they little guy (or gal) just ran when I got close.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;So then I remembered I had a cat carrier so I went back to my apartment and got my cat carrier.  When I returned I saw there were THREE kittens.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/CuOmG.jpg\"&gt;I setup my cat carrier&lt;/a&gt;.  But at this point I didn&amp;#39;t see them again that night so I packed it in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Several people suggested I get a trap from the local humane society.  The next day I did just that and got a humane trap.  But the weather gods were against me.  The tropical storm or depression or whatever it was rolled into Austin and it was pouring rain.  There was no way I could setup the trap where I had found the kittens originally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/O4wmB.jpg\"&gt;So instead I set it up on the deck of the subway attached to my apartment complex&lt;/a&gt; (the trap is on the right side, its hard to see).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway within 30 minutes one of the little guys showed up and got himself trapped!  First kitten rescued.  I totally forgot to take a picture and when I let him out in my apartment he immediately hid.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went back out and stayed for 2 hours in the pouring rain (the trap and I were shielded though) but to my dismay the other too kittens were no shows.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today I had off work due to previously mentioned weather incident so I figured I&amp;#39;d give it another shot despite the fact that it was still raining.  I set up the trap in the same spot, took my chair, listened to &lt;a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lg8LfoyDFUM\"&gt;Ronald Jenkees&lt;/a&gt; and browsed &lt;a href=\"http://www.reddit.com\"&gt;reddit&lt;/a&gt;.  I waited 30 minutes and no kittens had showed up so I started to lose faith.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;However just as I stood up one of the kittens jumped up onto the deck!  I backed away as stealthily as I could and waited.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"http://imgur.com/iu0rA.jpg\"&gt;This was the result&lt;/a&gt;!  So now I had two kittens, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to leave the third one all alone without his brothers (or sisters).  So out I went again braving the light drizzle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I waited an hour before the third one finally showed up.  And he was a tricky one, he wouldn&amp;#39;t even get close to the cage if he could see me (I was about 20 feet away mostly obscured by a trash can).  So I waited 5 minutes and then peaked.  He was trying to get at the food from outside the cage rather than go in.  He saw me and hid at the edge of the deck just peaking his head up to see if I was there.
